MovieMatch! is a web app that I decided to create after having a hard time with my significant other
when trying to figure out what to watch on any given night.

## Why it was created

After watching a youtube video for a similar idea I decided to try and create something similar but
implement my own wants/needs into the web app.

The current iteration is actually very simple. When the page reloads a new random movie is shown with
it's release date, runtime, poster, and a short plot. Currently it grabs from a json file that includes
every single movie ever made to date. There are no other functions other than reloading for now.

In the next version I will be adding/changing/removing some things. Some of the major ones to note would
be that it will only show movies from main stream streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime,
and Disney Plus. It will also have the option to select which of those to show from so you don't see
movies that you don't have access too. It will also have a way to actually save the movies you've
liked to a profile to where you can keep them stored so you won't ever have to remember the ones you
thought about watching or the ones you really wanted to watch but can't remember the name of at any
given time. The last major feature to be implemented will be a button, pretty much a button that says
Watch!, that will take you directly to that movie on the given streaming service that it is on.

The project will also probably be renamed to something that will fit it more since it will also be
showing shows/tv shows rather than just movies alone.

Alongside the above I'll also be migrating from Flask to Django so that I can use their already
created code for the admin panel and more!

## VERSION 2

Version 2 is currently being actively developed using the MERN stack.
